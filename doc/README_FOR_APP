========================

 * Install FreeSWITCH:
   * Mac: http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Installation_and_Tips_for_Mac_OS_X

 * Install Blink (a SIP client):
   * Download: http://icanblink.com/
   * Once installed, go to Preferences and add a new account:
     * SIP Address: 1000@<your-ip>
     * Password: 1234
     (these are the defualts for FreeSWITCH)
   * You can check if it works by calling the number 1000 (type it on the search box and press enter).
     This will call yourself :-P
